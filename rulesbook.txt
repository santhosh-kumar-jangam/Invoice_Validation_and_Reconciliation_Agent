1. Mandatory Field Presence
Invoice Number: Must be present, unique, and non-empty for traceability.
Invoice Date: Must exist and be in a valid date format (DD-MM-YYYY or ISO).
Vendor Details: Name, address, GSTIN/PAN must be complete and accurate.
Client Details: Name and address must be present and verifiable.
Product/Service Details: Invoice should list all items/services with clear descriptions.
Subtotal: Total amount before tax must be stated and non-negative.
Tax Details: Each tax component (e.g., CGST, SGST) must be listed with rates and amounts.
Grand Total: Total payable amount must be present and reconcile with subtotal plus taxes.
Currency: Currency code must be specified and consistent with amounts shown.
Bank Details: Bank name and account number must be complete if payment details are present.

2. Data Format and Type Checks
Dates: Invoice, due, and payment dates must be valid and formatted uniformly.
Monetary Values: All financial figures (unit prices, totals, taxes) must be numeric and non-negative.
Tax Identification Numbers: GSTIN, PAN, IFSC codes must adhere to prescribed formats.
Quantities: Product quantities should be integers greater than zero.

3. Mathematical Accuracy and Consistency
Subtotal Calculation: Sum of all product line totals should equal the subtotal (allowing minor rounding differences).
Tax Totals: Tax amounts must accurately reflect percentages applied to the taxable amount.
Grand Total Validation: Confirm grand total equals subtotal plus total tax plus any additional charges minus discounts.
Date Logic: Due date should not precede invoice date.
Currency Consistency: Currency symbol and code should match across the invoice.

4. Bank and Payment Information Checks
Incomplete Bank Information:
If payment instructions exist, absence of bank name, account number, or IFSC code must be flagged.
Payment Terms Missing:
Payment terms or conditions missing where normally required should be identified.

5. Field-Level Redundancy and Duplication
Duplicated Fields/Values:
Identify if any field (such as Invoice Number) appears in multiple places with different values—flag if any inconsistency.

6. Encoding Artifacts:
Flag corrupted characters (e.g., replacement �, “??”, “█” or similar) in any text fields, which may hint at extraction/encoding errors.
